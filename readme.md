> [!NOTE]
> **This is a fork** of [dvejsada/HA-RohlikCZ](https://github.com/dvejsada/HA-RohlikCZ) — all credit for the integration goes to its author. The fork tracks upstream and adds **live courier tracking**:
>
> - **Courier on the way** binary sensor — on from the moment the courier leaves with your order until it is delivered, with the courier's name, the number of bags, their phone (shared for the final approach), a `nearby` flag and the departure time as attributes
> - **Minutes to Delivery** sensor — minutes until the Delivery Time, ticking every minute (negative while the courier is late)
> - **Faster live ETA** — while the courier is on the way, the delivery announcement is refreshed every 2 minutes (every minute in the final 15 minutes) instead of every 10, so no polling automation is needed
> - **Courier card** — a slim full-width dashboard banner (`custom:rohlik-courier-card`) bundled with the integration; see [Courier card](#-courier-card-fork)
>
> Versions follow upstream with a fourth number for the fork's changes (`1.0.0.1` = upstream `1.0.0` + courier tracking). The changes are intended to be sent upstream as a pull request.

Bring your **[Rohlík.cz](https://www.rohlik.cz)** grocery deliveries into Home Assistant! Track deliveries, monitor your cart, automate shopping, and never miss a delivery window — all from your smart home dashboard.

> **What is Rohlík.cz?**  
> Rohlík.cz is one of the most popular online grocery and food-delivery services in the Czech Republic (also operating as Knuspr.de in Germany, Gurkerl.at in Austria, Kifli.hu in Hungary and Sezamo.ro in Romania — all supported by this integration). They deliver fresh groceries, household goods and more — often within hours.

> [!WARNING]
> This integration uses a reverse-engineered API from the Rohlík.cz website. It is **not** officially supported by Rohlík.cz. Use it at your own risk.

## 🚀 Installation

### Option 1 — HACS (Recommended)

Install in one click via the Home Assistant Community Store:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=hruskin&repository=HA-Rohlik-dynamic&category=Integration)

> Don't have HACS yet? [Get it here](https://hacs.xyz/).

#### Trying pre-releases

New versions are sometimes published as pre-releases (betas) first. HACS hides them by default; to try one, open **Rohlík.cz** in HACS, click **⋮ → Redownload**, enable **Show beta versions** and pick the version. Please [report anything you run into](https://github.com/hruskin/HA-Rohlik-dynamic/issues).

### Option 2 — Manual Installation

1. Download `rohlikcz.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/hruskin/HA-Rohlik-dynamic/releases/latest).
2. Extract it into a new `config/custom_components/rohlikcz/` directory in your Home Assistant configuration.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services** in your Home Assistant UI.
2. Click **Add Integration** (the `+` button in the bottom right).
3. Search for **Rohlik.cz** and select it.
4. Pick your **Shop** and enter its credentials:
   - **Shop** — Rohlík.cz, Knuspr.de, Gurkerl.at, Kifli.hu or Sezamo.ro
   - **Email** — your account email
   - **Password** — your account password
5. Click **Submit** — entities will be set up automatically.

Amounts (credit, cart total, spending) are reported in the shop's currency (CZK, EUR, HUF or RON).

> [!NOTE]
> If your password later changes or stops working, Home Assistant prompts you to re-enter it (**re-authentication**) instead of the integration silently failing. Each account can only be added once.

> [!TIP]
> Entries created before shop selection existed point at Rohlík.cz. To move one to another shop (e.g. Knuspr.de), open the integration entry's **⋮ menu → Reconfigure** and pick the shop — no need to remove and re-add it.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Delivery Time** sensor reads the courier's arrival time from the shop's delivery announcement. Announcements that give a clock time work in every shop; "in N minutes" countdowns are currently only understood in Czech.

### Optional: Spending Analytics

After setup you can enable **Spending Analytics** at any time via the integration's **Configure** button:

- Choose which category levels to track (top-level, mid-level, detailed, most specific, per-item)
- Set how many top items to display in sensor attributes (default: 10)
- Optionally hide discontinued products from rankings

Enabling analytics triggers a one-time download of your full order history (this may take several minutes).

## 📊 Entities

### 🔵 Binary Sensors

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Premium Membership** | Active when your premium subscription is valid; premium details available as attributes |
| **Reusable Bags** | Active when reusable bags are enabled on your account |
| **Next Order** | Active when you have a scheduled upcoming order; order details as attributes |
| **Timeslot Reservation** | Active when you have a reserved delivery timeslot |
| **Parents Club** | Active when you are a member of the Parents Club |
| **Express Available** | Active when express delivery is currently available in your area |
| **Courier on the way** | Active from the courier's departure until delivery; `departed_at`, `initial_eta` (ETA announced at departure), `courier`, `bags`, `phone`, `nearby`, `title` and `message` as attributes *(fork)* |

### 🟢 Sensors

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **First Available Delivery** | Earliest available delivery time with location details |
| **Account ID** | Your Rohlík.cz account identifier |
| **Email** | Your registered email address |
| **Phone** | Your registered phone number |
| **Remaining Orders Without Limit** | Premium orders with no minimum price limit remaining |
| **Remaining Free Express Deliveries** | Free express deliveries still available |
| **Credit Balance** | Your current account credit (in the shop's currency) |
| **Reusable Bags** | Number of reusable bags on your account |
| **Premium Days Remaining** | Days left in your premium subscription *(premium users only)* |
| **Cart Total** | Current total value of your shopping cart; the `Minimum Order Price` attribute holds the shop's minimum order value (compare it with the total — `Can Order` also needs checkout details such as a delivery slot) |
| **Last Updated** | Timestamp of the last successful data refresh |
| **Slot Express Time** | Timestamp of the next available express delivery slot |
| **Slot Standard Time** | Timestamp of the nearest standard delivery slot |
| **Slot Eco Time** | Timestamp of the nearest eco delivery slot |
| **Delivery Slot Start** | Start of the delivery window for your next order |
| **Delivery Slot End** | End of the delivery window for your next order |
| **Delivery Time** | Predicted exact delivery time for your next order |
| **Minutes to Delivery** | Minutes until the Delivery Time, updated every minute *(fork)* |
| **Monthly Spent** | Total amount spent this month |
| **Yearly Spent** | Total amount spent this year *(requires Spending Analytics)* |
| **All Time Spent** | Total spent across all tracked orders *(requires Spending Analytics)*; the `by_year` attribute breaks the total down per year (`total` and `order_count` per year) |

### 📅 Calendar

**Orders Calendar** — Shows all upcoming and recent delivery windows as calendar events (entity ID typically ending in `_orders_calendar`, for example `calendar.rohlikcz_orders_calendar`; your actual ID may vary).

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Event Title** | Order number (e.g., `Order 123456789`) |
| **Event Start** | Delivery window start time |
| **Event End** | Delivery window end time |
| **Event Description** | Order status, item count, and total price |
| **State** | `on` during an active delivery window, `off` otherwise |

Events are sourced from upcoming orders and the last 50 delivered orders. Events disappear automatically once an order falls outside that window.

**Ideas for using the calendar:**
- View all deliveries in the Home Assistant calendar UI
- Trigger automations when a delivery window starts
- Query upcoming deliveries with the `calendar.get_events` service

### 💰 Spending Analytics Sensors (opt-in)

When analytics levels are enabled in the integration options, the following sensors are created (each with "this year" and "all time" variants):

- **Top Categories** (L0) - Spending by top-level categories (e.g. Drinks, Drugstore)
- **Categories** (L1) - Spending by mid-level categories (e.g. Hot drinks, Cleaning products)
- **Detailed Categories** (L2) - Spending by detailed categories (e.g. Coffee, Universal cleaner)
- **Specific Categories** (L3) - Spending by most specific categories (e.g. Bean coffee, Spray cleaner)
- **Per-Item** - Spending by individual product (e.g. Tchibo Barista, Savo Spray)

Each sensor's attributes contain the top N items (configurable, default 10) sorted by spending, with `total_count`, `spent`, `units`, and `avg_unit_price` per entry.

---

## 🚚 Courier card *(fork)*

The integration ships a Lovelace card and loads it on every dashboard by itself — no resource to add and no other custom cards needed:

```yaml
type: custom:rohlik-courier-card
```

It is a slim full-width banner that appears **only while the courier is on the way** and hides itself otherwise (in the dashboard editor it shows a preview). Put it at the top of a sections dashboard. It shows:

- the countdown to the live ETA — *nearby* with the courier's phone in the final minutes, *Přijíždí* at arrival and *+N min* in orange when the courier is late,
- the trip progress from departure to the live ETA; when the ETA moves later the marker slides back and a small *+N* shows how far it shifted,
- the reusable bags to hand back to the courier.

Tapping it opens the **Courier on the way** details. The card finds the integration's entities on its own; with more than one account, pick them with `courier_entity`, `eta_entity`, `minutes_entity` and `bags_entity`.

## 🔧 Actions (Service Calls)

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **`rohlikcz.add_to_cart`** | Add a product to your cart by product ID and quantity |
| **`rohlikcz.search_product`** | Search for products available on Rohlík.cz by name |
| **`rohlikcz.search_and_add_to_cart`** | Search for a product by name and add it to your cart in one step |
| **`rohlikcz.get_shopping_list`** | Retrieve products from a saved Rohlík.cz shopping list by its ID |
| **`rohlikcz.get_cart_content`** | Get the current contents of your shopping cart |
| **`rohlikcz.update_data`** | Force an immediate full data refresh from Rohlík.cz |
| **`rohlikcz.refresh_slots`** | Cheaply refresh only the delivery-slot data with a single request — light enough to poll every few seconds to catch express availability |
| **`rohlikcz.update_delivery_times`** | Cheaply refresh only the delivery-time announcement with a single request — light enough to poll every minute to track the shifting delivery ETA |
| **`rohlikcz.fetch_order_history`** | Download your complete order history and store it locally (backfill) |
| **`rohlikcz.enrich_orders`** | Enrich stored orders with item details and product categories to populate the spending sensors |

> [!TIP]
> Want a notification the moment express delivery opens up? See [`automations/refresh_slots.yaml`](automations/refresh_slots.yaml) for an example that polls `refresh_slots` every 15 seconds while armed and notifies you when the **Express Available** sensor turns on.

> [!TIP]
> This fork refreshes the live ETA on its own while the courier is on the way (every 2 minutes, every minute in the final 15 minutes), so the [`automations/update_delivery_times.yaml`](automations/update_delivery_times.yaml) polling example is no longer needed.

---

## 🔄 Data Updates

Data is refreshed from Rohlík.cz **every 10 minutes** automatically; while the courier is on the way, the delivery announcement is refreshed every 2 minutes (every minute in the final 15 minutes). The update covers account details, premium status, delivery slots, shopping cart, and order history.

You can trigger an immediate refresh at any time using the **`rohlikcz.update_data`** action, refresh just the delivery slots more frequently with **`rohlikcz.refresh_slots`**, or refresh just the delivery-time announcement with **`rohlikcz.update_delivery_times`**.

---

## 🩺 Diagnostics

If something isn't working, download the integration's diagnostics from **Settings → Devices & Services → Rohlík.cz → ⋮ (three dots) → Download diagnostics** and attach the file to your bug report. Credentials and personal details (email, phone, name, address) are automatically redacted.
